### DDIA expectation
* Fill in the gaps and expose myself to a higher level of scaffolding and scale as well as backfill information I probably should have known but missed on being self taught.

### PMPP expectation
* Im expecting by the end to have a deep grasp of gpu programming, a good foundation on CUDA, and overall broader understanding of ML.

### ML-ENG expectation
* This is for fast tracking modern concepts of ML training and why people are doing what they are doing, so just getting a grip on that would be huge
