## Lesson 00-B
* Reading: [Kafka in 5 Mins](https://medium.com/@227karansingh/apache-kafka-in-5-minutes-cd13d5663f76)
* This just seems like redis with bulljs?
* just stores jobs in a stack like bull and redis. simple

### Kafka breakdown
* Producer: How the server sends a message to kafka
* message: the data (like a job in bull)
* Topic: where the messages are stored in categorized containers
* Consumer: The entity requesting messages from a specific topic
* Broker: load balance and handling message traffic
* Zookeeper: Manages Brokers
* Partition:  Stores multiple Topics in a file. Kafka manages multiple partitions
* Offset: unique id(i.e. line number of the message) for a message in a partition. Used by Kafka to track which messages has been processed


### Why Kafka
* Zero data loss, scalable, async, and tracking off offsets means no duplicate message processes or missed messages for consumers

### struggles
* holy shit that was AIDS. docker-compose and kafka blew to get setup but I updated the README so everyone else should have an easier time :)
